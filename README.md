# Reproducible projects in R - workshop materials

This repo is a placeholder for workshop materials.

## Workshop content
![](workshop_advert.png)

*This is a practical workshop that will cover:*

1. Working in Rstudio efficiently and reproducibly - using "**.Rproj**" functionality and **renv** environments to maintain code and files in your projects

2. Using **Git with Rstudio** for version control (locally and on the server e.g. slade)

3. **Bringing it all together**: using Rstudio with Git on **UKB-RAP**/**All of Us** platforms to maintain your projects

_Not covering: Python and Jupyter notebooks, but some concepts are transferrable._

All participants must have Git/GitHub account set up  (see below) and ready to follow along during the hands-on session.



## Workshop prep / Git set-up instructions

Part of the workshop will involve some basic interaction with GitHub. To make sure everything runs smoothly, you'll need to have your GitHub account and settings ready in advance. I’ve put together a short checklist below. 

If you’ve used Git from your current laptop before (i.e. via the command line or a Git client, and not via GitHub web interface, i.e. ‘add files via upload’), your setup is probably fine, and you don’t need to do anything.  If not, or if you’re unsure, please complete the following steps before the workshop:

- Create a **GitHub.com account** (make sure you know your username/email and password)
- Create a **personal access token**.  This is different from the account login password and is required to add code to your GitHub account. To create a new token (or if you are not sure that you have it), follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
Tip: don’t set an expiration date for your token and save it somewhere reliable, e.g. in a password manager
- Check Git is installed on your computer by running  **git --version** on the Terminal
- **Configure Git** with your GitHub account on your laptop - follow the steps in sections "First-Time Git Setup” and “Connect to GitHub with SSH” [here](https://gist.github.com/qin-yu/bc26a2d280ee2e93b2d7860a1bfbd0c5)
